ðŸŒŸ About Me:
As a dedicated third-year Computer Science student at PJATK, Poland, I'm deeply engrossed in the intricate world of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science. With a voracious appetite for knowledge and innovation, I'm committed to unlocking the transformative potential of data and algorithms.


ðŸš€ My Journey:
My journey began with a fascination for web development, particularly front-end technologies, where I honed my skills in creating engaging user interfaces. As my academic path unfolded, my interests gravitated towards the more complex, yet profoundly impactful realms of AI, ML, and Data Science. This pivot was fueled by a desire to not only understand but also contribute to the cutting-edge advancements driving our digital future.


ðŸ’¡ Integration of Interests:
While my primary focus is now on AI, ML, and Data Science, I continue to nurture my front-end development skills. I am a firm believer in the harmonious blend of intuitive user interfaces with the intelligent algorithms operating behind the scenes. My ultimate goal is to synthesize these disciplines to develop solutions that are as smart as they are user-friendly.
